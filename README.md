# RUST-Parser
Implementation of a parser for a subset of the Rust language.

The subset of the language includes:

- a single function: fn main () {...}

- Integers and Booleans

- Arithmetic expressions

- Boolean expressions

- Assignments (let)

- If and If then else

- While Cycles

- Command strings (separated by ;)

- Input / output functions (println and read_line)

The parser parses the program for the requested Rust subset, and outputs a representation of the abstract tree (union in C).
